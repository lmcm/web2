Once Brazil declared its independence (1822) and became a republic in 1889, the stage was set for a new capital to be chosen. Among several contestants, the small avillage of Curral del-Rei achieved the right to host the Cidade de Minas, officially inaugurated in 1897 and whose name was eventually changed in 1906 to Belo Horizonte (Portuguese for ‘beautiful horizon\u0027).\r\n\r\nEngineer Aarao Reis, an admirer of Paris and Washington, D.C., was responsible for putting the urban planning for the new state capital together. What his project did not contemplate, though, was the fast-paced development through which Belo Horizonte would go after a period of stagnation in the first decades of the 20th century. Soon the city expanded beyond its original limits and new neighbourhoods had to be planned and developed - the most notorious of them the Pampulha, an area of wide avenues and many squares and parks designed in the 1940s by Brazil\u0027s premier architect Oscar Niemeyer.\r\n\r\nToday Belo Horizonte - or Beagá, as the city is famously known, after the sound of initials BH in Portuguese - is the sixth-most populous city in Brazil with just over 2.4 million residents, while its metropolitan area comprising a total 34 cities ranks third in the country, behind Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.\r\n\r\nFrom the beauty of its green areas to the careful city-planning; from the wide array of cultural activities to the nature wonders of the Serra do Curral surrounding it, Belo Horizonte has several reasons for being constantly appointed as one of the Latin American metropolises that provides the best qualify of life.\r\n\r\nFootball\r\nThe number one question when someone meets a belo-horizontino is often the same: Atletico Mineiro or Cruzeiro? The city is in love with football and lives under a constant atmosphere of rivalry between two of the top contenders in Brazilian football: Clube Atlético Mineiro, the Galo (Rooster), and Cruzeiro Esporte Clube, also known as the Raposa (Fox). América Futebol Clube, the Coelho (Rabbit), is also a traditional state rival and has had its successful surges over the years.\r\n\r\nAtlético Mineiro was the winner of the maiden edition of the Campeonato Brasileiro in 1971, and has been graced by the talents of Reinaldo, Toninho Cerezo and Eder, among others, while Cruzeiro\u0027s silverware collection goes from one Brasileiro in 2003 to four Copa do Brasil titles, two Copa Libertadores crowns (1976 and 1997). The Raposa were the first stage in the career of such big names as Tostao and Ronaldo.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate stage for the Atlético vs. Cruzeiro derbies and for the big matches held in the state of Minas Gerais is Governor Magalhaes Pinto stadium, famously known as the Mineirão; a 72,000-seater that has once housed over 100,000 fans and is one of the best and most charismatic football grounds in Brazil that has gone through modernisation work to turn it into a comfortable 58,000-seater."},{"idCiudad":"2","nombre":"Brasilia","urlImg":"http://img.fifa.com/mm/photo/tournament/destination/73/83/08/738308_small.jpg","urlImg2":"http://img.fifa.com/mm/photo/tournament/destination/73/83/08/738308_full-lnd.jpg","descripcion":"The construction of this ultra-modern city, situated in the centre of Brazil, began in 1956. Since its official foundation on 21 April 1960, the city has served the purpose for which it was built: to replace Rio de Janeiro as the country\u0027s capital. As a result, the bulk of Brazil\u0027s federal administration and political power are centred here.\r\n\r\nThe move to take the capital away from the coast gradually began gathering momentum after Brazil gained independence in 1822. The switch was intended to symbolise the country\u0027s change from a colonial state to an independent nation, and this intention was legally documented in 1891 by an article in the Constitution. But it was not until 1953, under the presidency of Getulio Vargas, that the idea resurfaced. It fell to another president, Juscelino Kubitschek, to bring the project to fruition, with the start of construction in 1956 and the city\u0027s official founding four years later both coming during his time in office.\r\n\r\nOne of the city\u0027s striking features is its wide avenues, which surround both its public buildings and its two districts, one to the north and the other to the south. These are divided into so-called superblocks, each of which contain numerous buildings. The central part of the cross is the Praça dos Três Poderes (Three Powers\u0027 Square). Here can be found the country\u0027s seats of Executive and Legislative Power as well as the headquarters of the Supreme Federal Court.\r\n\r\nWidely considered to be avant-garde city in architectural terms, the Metropolitan Cathedral of Brasilia and the Juscelino Kubitschek Bridge are without doubt the most iconic structures. Both were designed by Oscar Niemeyer, the man behind most of the landmark buildings in the new capital. Due to its architectural feats,\r\n\r\nBrasilia is the only city in the world constructed in the 20th century to have been declared a World Heritage site by UNESCO.\r\n\r\nFootball\r\nThe Federal District of which Brasília is the capital is home to two clubs that have had recent successful surges in Brazil\u0027s elite: Sociedade Esportiva do Gama and Brasiliense Futebol Clube - the surprising runners-up of the Copa do Brasil in 2002.\r\n\r\nBrasília has a recognized tradition in hosting first-rate sporting events and was one of the host cities of the FIFA Futsal World Cup 2008, which was played at the Nilson Nelson - a sports hall situated right in front of the brand new Estadio Nacional Mane Garrincha - a 70,000-seater that is now one of the biggest stadiums in the country. The city also boasts two other important football grounds in the Serejão, where Brasiliense plays its home matches, and the Bezerrão - which was completely redesigned and inaugurated in November 2008 with the presence of the Seleção in a 6-2 blow out win over Portugal."},{"idCiudad":"3","nombre":"Cuiaba","urlImg":"http://img.fifa.com/mm/photo/tournament/destination/01/03/73/21/1037321_small.jpg","urlImg2":"http://img.fifa.com/mm/photo/tournament/destination/01/03/73/21/1037321_full-lnd.jpg","descripcion":"The capital of the state of Mato Grosso, Cuiaba is located in the exact geographic centre of South America, an equidistant 2,000 km from the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Established in 1719 during the Brazilian Gold Rush, its centre still houses several historical buildings that have been declared national heritage sites in 1992.\r\n\r\nFor about 250 years, Cuiaba stood quietly as a small city in the Centre-western region of Brazil. The scenario changed promptly in the 20th century, when the federal government implanted an expansion plan towards the interior of the country, which resulted in roadways connecting Mato Grosso to the states of Goias and Sao Paulo. In 30 years, the population increased dramatically from around 57,000 inhabitants in 1960 to 400,000 in 1990. The vast 3,538-square kilometre area of Cuiaba is currently the home of 544,737 people.\r\n\r\nCuiabá stands on a privileged location for tourists, as it confronts three of Brazil\u0027s most important and characteristic ecosystems: the savannahs of the Cerrado; the wetlands of the Pantanal; and the Amazon. With such a massive presence of nature, it is no wonder, then, that Cuiaba has been nicknamed ‘Green City\u0027. The cuiabanos also neighbour one of Brazil\u0027s most startling landscapes, the mountain range of Chapada dos Guimaraes, where archaeological sites and a 3,300-square kilometre National Park attract thousands of visitors every year.\r\n\r\nThe Chapada dos Guimaraes is one of the reasons why Cuiabá is considered the hottest state capital in Brazil, as the mountain range blocks the polar masses and helps driving temperatures to over 40º C during the summer.\r\n\r\nFootball\r\nMixto Esporte Clube, from Cuiabá, is the most important club within the state of Mato Grosso and holds one of the biggest fan bases in the Centre-western region of Brazil. The Tigre (Tiger) hold the record for most state titles, and played in the first division of the Campeonato Brasileiro for 11 straight seasons from 1976. However, Mixto have not rejoined the elite since. Their main city rivals are Cuiaba Esporte Clube and Clube Esportivo Dom Bosco, besides Operário Futebol Clube, from the neighbouring city of Várzea Grande.\r\n\r\nThe Jose Fragelli stadium, also known as the Verdão (Big Green), was the most important stadium in Mato Grosso until 2010. The 45,000-seater ground was built in 1976, and has hosted four of Brazil\u0027s friendlies; the most recent one a 6-1 win over Iceland in March 2002.

Since it was declared the capital of the state of Paraná in 1853, the city has gone through several major urban planning projects to avoid uncontrolled growth and thus has become an international role model in dealing with such sensitive issues as transportation and the environment.\r\n\r\nCuritiba is now the most populous city in the southern region of Brazil, with 1.8m inhabitants, and stands right at the centre of a metropolitan area whose economy ranks fourth in terms of contribution to the country\u0027s gross national product. With all that, Curitiba still maintains the structural conditions to offer a remarkable welfare and quality of life to its residents, thanks to its innumerable parks and a high-profile cultural schedule.\r\n\r\nThe curitibanos owe a lot of their cultural richness to the massive immigration process through which the south of Brazil underwent during the 19th century, when it welcomed a huge contingent of Germans, Italians, Ukrainians and Polish. These traits are noticeable in such city landmarks as the Santa Felicidade neighbourhood, with its first-class Italian cantinas; the Bosque Alemão (German Wood) and the Ukrainian church replica at fabulous Tingui Park\r\n\r\nBesides the Tingui, other important parks that showcase Curitiba\u0027s concern with preserving green areas include the Tangua, the Barigui and the impressive Botanical Garden. Other city attractions revolve around its pulsating cultural life, like the Opera de Arame (a theatre all built with glass and iron wires) and the poignant Oscar Niemeyer Museum, designed by the architect himself.\r\n\r\nFootball\r\nCuritiba is home to two traditional clubs of Brazilian football: Coritiba Foot Ball Club and Clube Atletico Paranaense, who meet for one of the most exciting derbies in the country, the Atletiba - a reason for frenzy in Curitiba since the two teams\u0027 very first meeting in 1924.\r\n\r\nCoritiba, nicknamed Coxa, conquered the Campeonato Brasileiro title in 1985 and own the Couto Pereira stadium, while rivals Atletico Paranaense, the Furacão (Hurricane), were national champions in 2001 and are proud owners of the Joaquim Americo stadium, popularly known as Arena da Baixada, which was demolished and rebuilt from the scratch in 1999 and is now considered one of the best and most modern football grounds in Brazil\r\n\r\nThe city\u0027s third representative in Brazil\u0027s main football scene are Parana Clube, founded in 1989 as a fusion of two other teams; Colorado and Pinheiros.

It has also developed into an important economic centre and a densely populated metropolitan area: over 2.4 million people reside within its 313 square kilometres (120,8 sq mi).\r\n\r\nMost of the tourist attractions in Fortaleza revolve around its beaches: the Praia do Futuro (Future Beach) popular for its several barracas - simple kiosk-restaurants built on the sand that serve fresh, typical seafood - while Iracema is the place for bars and nightclubs. There is also more bucolic Mucuripe Beach, from where fishermen venture into the sea with their jangadas (handmade wooden boats). The coastal Beira Mar avenue is also the place for a traditional daily craftsmen\u0027s fair and for some of the top spots to dance the forró, a typical rhythm from the north-east of Brazil.\r\n\r\nOver the decades, Fortaleza has invested in infra-structure for tourism and in new features such as the Centro Dragão do Mar de Arte e Cultura  (Sea Dragon Art and Culture Centre) and the Beach Park, Brazil\u0027s largest water park, with several cutting-edge speed-slides distributed along 35,000 square kilometres.\r\n\r\nFootball\r\nTwo of the most popular clubs from the north-east of Brazil come from Fortaleza: Ceara Sporting Club and Fortaleza Esporte Clube. Both teams have historically shared the attention of the fans throughout the whole state of Ceará, as well as the state titles.\r\n\r\nThe two sides have also played memorable roles in national competitions: Ceará were the runner-ups in the Copa do Brasil in 1994, when they lost to Gremio, and they reached the semi finals in 2005, while Fortaleza finished runners-up twice in the Taca Brasil (a predecessor to the Campeonato Brasileiro), in 1960 and 1968.\r\n\r\nThe city of Fortaleza offers two main stadiums for the matches involving Ceara, Fortaleza and Ferroviário Esporte Clube: the state-owned Plácido Castelo, also known as the Castelão, and the city-owned Presidente Vargas.

The dark-coloured waters of the former and the muddy waters of the latter flow side by side for over 18 kilometres without mixing, forming one of the Amazon\u0027s most majestic sights.\r\n\r\nSince it was first inhabited in 1669, Manaus steadily evolved into the capital of the state of Amazonas and finally into the metropolis of the Amazon. Manaus is now the 12th most populous city in Brazil, with just over two million inhabitants, and became an economic powerhouse during the 20th century, after the construction of the Manaus Industrial Pole.\r\n\r\nThe equatorial climate of Manaus is another of its most interesting traits, with an annual temperature average of 28ºC, air humidity of over 80 per cent and two very defined seasons: the rainy one (December to May) and the so-called dry season, between June and November, when precipitation is not as intense and temperatures may reach as high as 40ºC.\r\n\r\nThe combination of outstanding natural beauty, local traditions and a metropolis on the rise gives Manaus a unique atmosphere, thanks to such diverse features as the Teatro Amazonas - an impressive concert hall that houses the annual Amazonas Opera Festival - and the Boi-Manaus, which is a celebration of the city\u0027s anniversary, rocked by the sounds of the typical rhythm of the \"boi-bumbá\".\r\n\r\nFootball\r\nThe city of Manaus is home to a majority of football clubs in the state of Amazonas and, therefore, several rivalries.

Brazil defeated an Amazonas State Team 4-1 in a match that was witnessed by such dignitaries as then-FIFA President Stanley Rous.\r\n\r\nFor the next FIFA World Cup, the Vivaldão will be turned into one of the most beautiful stadiums in Brazil, the 42,618-seater Arena Amazônia."},{"idCiudad":"7","nombre":"Natal","urlImg":"http://img.fifa.com/mm/photo/tournament/destination/01/03/73/28/1037328_small.jpg","urlImg2":"http://img.fifa.com/mm/photo/tournament/destination/01/03/73/28/1037328_full-lnd.jpg","descripcion":"On 25 December 1597, back when Brazil was a colony of the Portuguese crown, a group of Portuguese officials reached the Potengi River with the duty of reclaiming the captaincy of Rio Grande do Norte, which was then dominated by French buccaneers. Twelve days later, on 6 January, Three Kings\u0027 Day for the Catholic Churc, the group started the construction of the fortress that would remain the most prominent landmark in the state of Rio Grande do Norte until today: the Three Kings\u0027 Fort.\r\n\r\nFollowing Portugal\u0027s recovery of the territory, expedition leader Jeronimo de Albuquerque redefined the limits of that village by the Potengi river on 25 December 1599. There is uncertainty about on which of the two dates the name originated - that 25 December or the one two years earlier - but that was how it all started for Natal (Portuguese for ‘Christmas\u0027).\r\n\r\nThe capital of Rio Grande do Norte enjoyed moderate growth until the 20th century, when its innumerous striking beaches and sand dunes were finally surrounded by the proper infrastructure for tourists.

Founded in 1742 by immigrants from the Portuguese archipelago of Azores, the capital of Rio Grande do Sul was the destination of thousands of immigrants from Portugal and Italy - like many other cities in Brazil but also from other European countries, particularly Germany and Poland.\r\n\r\nBesides that, as the state is located far down the south of Brazil, the gaúchos, as people from Rio Grande do Sul are called, share several cultural traits with their neighbours from Argentina and Uruguay, from the folklore music to the habit of drinking the mate infusion, or chimarrão.\r\n\r\nPorto Alegre lies on the eastern bank of the Guaíba River, right at the convergence point of five other rivers, which together form the enormous Lagoa dos Patos (Ducks Lagoon). Its 497 square kilometres are covered with more than one million trees, making it one of the greenest cities in Brazil, despite being the nucleus of the fourth-most populous metropolitan area in the country, with roughly four million inhabitants. There are over 1.4 million people living within the boundaries of Porto Alegre.\r\n\r\nTemperatures are a lot milder in Porto Alegre than they are in most of the Brazilian capitals, with an annual temperature average of 19.5ºC and cold winters that have historical records of snow and subzero temperatures. The four seasons are very defined, though, and during the summer, temperatures may go well beyond 35ºC. The capital of Rio Grande do Sul is also famous for featuring one of the highest human development index figures in the whole country.\r\n\r\nFootball\r\nThe football scene in the city of Porto Alegre is divided in two halves: the black and blue one from Gremio Foot-Ball Porto Alegrense and the red and white from Sport Club Internacional. The two teams share the passion of the porto-alegrenses and are two of the most important clubs in the history of Brazilian football.\r\n\r\nBesides dominating the history books of Rio Grande do Sul, Gremio and Inter also combine for a number of national and international titles: while the Tricolor have conquered the Campeonato Brasileiro title twice (1981 and 1996), the Copa do Brasil four times (1989, 1994, 1997 and 2001), the Copa Libertadores twice (1983 and 1995) and the Toyota Cup once (1983), o Colorado have keep their silverware gallery packed with three Brasileiro titles (1975, 1976 and 1979), one Copa do Brasil (1992), two Libertadores (2006 and 2010), one FIFA Club World Cup (2006), one Copa Sul-Americana (2008), among many others.\r\n\r\nBoth Gremio and Internacional own traditional and highly regarded stadiums for over 50,000 spectators, separated some 2.5 km from each other: the Olímpico Monumental and the Beira-Rio, respectively.

Because of its economical importance for the region, the city is often called ‘the capital of the North-east\u0027.\r\n\r\nThe histories of Recife and Olinda run parallel to each other. For several years, Recife (Portuguese for ‘reef\u0027) existed essentially as the port that connected the village of Olinda to the Atlantic. The build-up of Recife was profoundly boosted by the presence of the Dutch in the north-east of Brazil. As the Dutch West India Company dominated the region, Maurice of Nassau disembarked in Recife in 1637 and ordered the construction of the bridges, canals and levees of the then-called Mauritsstad (Maurice City), which was the capital of the Dutch colonies in the Americas. Maurice of Nassau\u0027s term only lasted until 1644, but Recife inherited its architectural legacy that eventually led to the nickname ‘the Brazilian Venice\u0027.\r\n\r\nSome of the most impressive beaches around the state\u0027s capital are Boa Viagem, one of the most famous urban beaches of the region, and Porto de Galinhas, which stands among the top tourist destinations in the country, located some 70km away from Recife.\r\n\r\nHowever, because of the Dutch presence and the several twists of fate over its history, besides the tropical climate and the spectacular beaches that are common to the north-eastern coast of Brazil, the region of Recife is also prolific on historical attributes, such as the Orange Fort and the very city of Olinda, which was declared a world heritage site by UNESCO in 1982.\r\n\r\nThere is no better time to check the traditions of Recife and Olinda closely than carnival, when the rhythms of frevo and maracatu completely take the cities over and rock street parades like the Galo da Madrugada (‘Dawn Rooster\u0027), which brings two million people to the streets every year.\r\n\r\nFootball\r\nYou will hardly find another city in Brazil as football-mad as Recife.

This bustling metropolis, located between a tropical forest and a series of magnificent beaches, is an ideal base for exploring either, while the Cidade Maravilhosa has everything fans of modern urban life could wish for.\r\n\r\nRio de Janeiro is without doubt a city packed with contrasts: its striking colonial architecture recalling a bygone era while its imposing modern buildings represent a bright future. Perhaps the two most iconic sights are the Sugarloaf Mountain and the statue of Christ the Redeemer, which sits atop the Corcovado Mountain, these images winging their way around the world on the front of millions of postcards.\r\n\r\nFootball\r\nRio de Janeiro is the very depiction of Brazilian football with all forms of kick abouts taking on its streets, public parks and vast beaches. It comes as no surprise, then, that the city is the birthplace of such world-renowned footballers as Jairzinho, Zico, Ronaldo and Romario, to name but a few.\r\n\r\nFour of Brazil\u0027s biggest and most popular clubs are based in the Cidade Maravilhosa: Botafogo, Fluminense, Vasco da Gama and Flamengo, the club with the country\u0027s biggest fan base, of over 30 million aficionados.\r\n\r\nFootball is like a religion for the cariocas, and its temple is undoubtedly the mythical state-owned Maracana, arguably the most famous and once the largest stadium in the world. Officially named Mario Filho Stadium, after a famous sports journalist, the Maracana was inaugurated shortly before the 1950 FIFA World Cup in Brazil and hosted five of the home country\u0027s six matches in that competition, including the fateful 1-2 loss to Uruguay in the final match of the tournament. The resounding defeat on 16 July 1950 - dubbed Maracanazo by world champions Uruguay - was to be forever remembered as a national disaster in Brazil.\r\n\r\nThe Maracana has been completely renewed for the FIFA World Cup, in order to offer absolute comfort while still being the largest stadium in Brazil as a 75,117-seater. \r\n\r\nThe Engenhão, which was built as a venue for the Pan-American Games in 2007 and will be used in the 2016 Olympic Games, is the home ground of Botafogo.

This is one of the reasons why the coastal city in the country\u0027s north-east was one of the main poles of slave trade in South America. As a consequence, Salvador grew under deep influence of Portuguese, Afro-descendents and indigenous alike: a situation that contributed to the cultural richness that typifies the city today.\r\n\r\nThe presence of African elements is all around in Salvador, from the circles of capoeira (a combination of martial art and dance brought to Brazil by African slaves) at the Modelo Martket to the beat of the agogôs and atabaques (percussion instruments) in the rites of the Candomblé - a syncretic religion conceived in Brazil. Such African heritage has awarded Salvador with the nickname Roma Negra (Black Rome).\r\n\r\nSalvador\u0027s privileged topography is one of its most appealing attributes, with a clear division between the Cidade Baixa and Cidade Alta (Low City and High City), both of which are connected to each other by one of the city\u0027s most important sights, the Elevador Lacerda. But the ultimate icon of the city is the Pelourinho, which is its historical centre: its churches and colourful colonial buildings have been a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1985.\r\n\r\nBesides being a historical gem and the birthplace of several of Brazil\u0027s most significant artists, the capital of the state of Bahia has also grown and developed to become the economic centre in the north-east and the country\u0027s third-most populous city, with roughly three million residents.\r\n\r\nFootball\r\nIt comes as a surprise to no-one after an edition of the Campeonato Brasileiro when the figures show that a team from Salvador - either Esporte Clube Bahia or Esporte Clube Vitória - topped the attendance average charts. The soteropolitanos are as mad about football as anyone else in Brazil.\r\n\r\nThe two rivals comfortably dominate the football scene within the state of Bahia, and have an important national background as well: Bahia, the Tricolor, won the Campeonato Brasileiro in 1988 and the Taca Brasil in 1959 (a predecessor of the national championships), while Vitória have collected three North-east Cup titles and were runners-up in the Brasileiro in 1993. The Leão are also famous for housing one of the best youth academies in the country, having produced the likes of FIFA World Cup™ champions Bebeto and Dida.\r\n\r\nOne of the most fantastic moments for one to be in Salvador - only comparable to the city\u0027s vivacious Carnival celebrations - is during a Ba-Vi, the famous derby between the two rivals. While Vitoria owns the Barradão and EC Bahia plays its home matches at state-owned Pituaçu, the ultimate stage for big matches at the state of Bahia is the Fonte Nova, which has been closed since 2007. The former stadium was imploded and a brand new one is being built upon the same ground to host the FIFA World Cup."},{"idCiudad":"12","nombre":"Sao Paulo","urlImg":"http://img.fifa.com/mm/photo/tournament/destination/01/01/76/29/1017629_small.jpg","urlImg2":"http://img.fifa.com/mm/photo/tournament/destination/01/01/76/29/1017629_xbig-lnd.jpg","descripcion":"The Brazil Live Qualifier Event for FIWC10 will take place at Morumbi Mall in Sao Paulo.
